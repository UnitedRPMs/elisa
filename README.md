Elisa is a music player with a library where music can be browsed by album, artist or all tracks. It is indexed using either a private indexer or an indexer using Baloo. The private one can be configured to scan music on chosen paths. The Baloo one is faster because Baloo is providing all needed data from its own database. Play-lists can be built and played.
